Report is on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/11392242wksjgkyqzwxh) but it is also its own git repo (hosted by overleaf). This means changes can be committed and tracked directly from this repo, and pushed to the overleaf document. This is the preferred contribution method to the report.

Model submissions are posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/epfml-higgs).

Report submission is posted on [hotcrp](https://epfml17.hotcrp.com/).

The data is from the Higgs Boson decay signature, and comes from the LHC at CERN. [Details](https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr/files/2014/04/documentation_v1.8.pdf.)
